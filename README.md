# Problem Statment:
To digitize the traditional Exaphthalmometer and incease the precision of the instrument.

# solution:
To solve this problem, we redesigned the instrument by adding two cameras at the two end.
Used k-means clustering algorithm to calculate the distance between socket bone and front of the cornnea.
